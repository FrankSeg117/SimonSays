# PA1: Simon Game
This project is based on the original Simon game.
This repository is part of a Programming Assignment for the Advanced Programming Course. 
The purpose of this project is to creatively help the student create practical programming skills by implementing changes to the base code that require strong understanding of the concepts discussed in class.

## Setup
1. Clone this project inside an OpenFrameworks installation's "apps/myApps/" directory
2. Run the command "make" in the terminal or the "Build" Task in VSCode.
3. To run the project using the included debug configurations you must open the "launch.json" file
found in ".vscode/". In "launch.json" change the "program" attribute for the corresponding configuration (according to your OS)
to reflect the path to your executable. The executable will have the same name as this repository, and if on Windows, it 
will end in ".exe"
